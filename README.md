# react-events-cw

Create a React app that will increase the points-per-click for each player after clicking one of the buttons at the top of the page. See 2019-04-02_cw.png in this project as a reference.

Create a React app with two Components: GameBoard and Player. Gameboard should have 3 buttons and 3 Player components. The three buttons should be labels as 1pt, 3pt, and 5pts. The Player component should have a label for player name, a label for score, and a button called Increase Score.

Clicking on the player button will add 1 point to their score. If you click on 1pt, 3pt, or 5pt buttons in GameBoard the score will be increased by each click when pressing the Increase Score button in the Player component by the appropriate amount.
