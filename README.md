Increase the amount of points for each button click with 3 places to click a button on a page.

Create 3 sets of labels with buttons below them for 3 different “players” (it doesn't need to be in table). Each label should say Player 1, 2, or 3 with a zero after the text and a button with the text “1pt”. Above that create 3 more buttons with 1pt, 5pts, 10pts.

Clicking on the player button will add 1 point to their score, which is the zero after their label. If you click on 1pt, 5pts, or 10pts clicking on the player button will increase each click by the appropriate amount.

### Challenge:

Change the button label on each button and make the labels and buttons horizontal on the page.
